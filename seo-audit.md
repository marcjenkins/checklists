# SEO Audit

## Indexation

- [ ] Crawl the site using [Screaming Frog](http://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/)
- [ ] Check site is setup in Google Search Console
- [ ] Check any 4 or 500 errors and ensure others are working correctly (301s, etc.)
- [ ] Check robots.txt to see what's being blocked and to see if it's being done correctly
- [ ] Check if an XML sitemap exists
- [ ] Is the sitemap submitted to Google and Bing?

## Content
- [ ] Run the [W3C Validator](http://validator.w3.org/) - not of huge important but could affect rankings if there are too many errors
- [ ] Use [Pingdom](http://tools.pingdom.com/) and [Page Speed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights_extensions) to look at page speed
- [ ] Check for duplicate content
- [ ] Check pages are keyword focused and check for keyword stuffing or over opimisation
- [ ] Is a blog or other form of content publishing happening?
- [ ] Check hierachy in flow of pages 

## On-page elements
- [ ] URL structure
- [ ] Title tag
- [ ] Meta description
- [ ] Headings
- [ ] Internal linking
- [ ] Quality content
- [ ] Images (file names and alt tags)
- [ ] Broken links

## Basic link analysis
- [ ] How many root domains are linking to the site?
- [ ] How authoritative are those domains?
- [ ] What is the root domain to total links count?
- [ ] Do links come from diverse origins? Images, text, etc.
- [ ] Is anchor text diversified, or significantly over optimized? A healthy mix of naked URLs, branded, and misc anchor text, are characteristics of a healthy link profile.
- [ ] Competitor link analysis
